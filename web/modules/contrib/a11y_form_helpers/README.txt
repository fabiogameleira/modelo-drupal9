A11Y: Form Elements
==============================================
Make all your forms in Drupal more accessible.
This won't fix every accessibility issue with Drupal forms.

## Features
* No HTML5 validation
* Readable error messages for screen readers
* Autocomplete attributes for form elements
* More to follow...

This isn't a permanent module, if a feature is no longer needed in an upcoming Drupal release. It will be removed from the next major release.

## Supported modules
* Inline Form Errors (Core)
* Webform (Contrib)
* All field modules (Core and Contrib)

## Installation
Install this module, like any other module. No configuration needed.

## Theming
De module has its own templates, based on the various themes in Drupal Core.
To create your own template for your theme, use the one from System or one of the base themes that apply to your theme.
